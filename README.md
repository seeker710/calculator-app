# Calculator app

This is a calculator web page with various themes that I made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## General:  

I've created output boxes and buttons using **HTML flex** and **grid**, which I found to be very useful for layout.

I've used **SCSS**, a modified form of standard CSS, for styling.

And all of the features are implemented with **JavaScript**.

**Eval()**, which accepts a string as input and calculates the expression, is the keyÂ function employed.

## Themes and output:
